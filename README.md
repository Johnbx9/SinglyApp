# SinglyApp
During the winter break (January to February), a couple of students from CUNY tech prep and I decided to see if we could create 
an app before the spring semester start. This is what we came up with. It's called singly, as it's an app for recording yourself sing. 

Technologies we've used:

Cordova (cross-platform development)

AngularJS

Ionic framework

Parse (back-end)

Slack (for Communication)

This was built in less than 4 weeks. There’s still bugs in the app, but once summer hits we’ll come back to fix those bugs.
